<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Anna Jaffe</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
  
  
<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->
    
     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Field or Career</h1>
    
  <h2>Obviously, I am currently a student. I am not sure exactly what I want to do career-wise, but my major should set me up to be able to do work in marketing, journalism, PR, graphic design, and more. This summer I worked at a manufacturing company and ran their social media accounts and did communications with passive customers. Unfortunately, the original summer plan of being a camp counselor was cancelled due to COVID, but I did gain a new work experience. This fall, I hold an internship position at Hillel. And I also run a social media account for a non-profit that specializes in advocacy for menstrual equality and women's rights.</h2>

Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

Additionally, I am very close with my cousins and grandparents on both sides. I feel beyond blessed that my family really values travel and immersing ourselves in different cultures. Some of my best family memories come from our vacations. From hiking in Colorado and Costa Rica, to surfing in Mexico, learning in Israel, and eating in Spain and Italy, we have all bonded so much. My family has really shaped my values and they all serve as my biggest role models and supporters. </h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>Media has played a big part in my life as I am constantly learning and fueling myself through music, movies, books, sports, and more. Music has always been very important to me as some of my best moments from growing up are singing songs with my family in the car or doing silly dances in the kitchen. A special tradition in my family is singing the song Thunder Road by Bruce Springsteen at every large gathering such as weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, and even funerals. I also swear that my Spotify playlists are the most organized component of my life. Additionally, my family are all HUGE Michigan Wolverine fans, as we used to live in Michigan. I always like to say that "If I can't be hailing to Pitt, I'll be hailing to the victors." I have also always found comfort in reading, movies and TV because I think that they are one of the best ways to learn about our own world but to also escape to different worlds. Some of my favorite movies include Garden State, Whiplash, Interstellar, and Almost Famous. Lastly, meditation plays a huge role in my life as I try to meditate daily and some of the best books and podcasts I have listened to or read have to do with meditation and consciousness. </h2>

    <!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) --> 
    
<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)--> 

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Community</h1>
    </div>
   
    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>Growing up, I moved a lot. I have lived in three different states and gone to 5 different schools. Thus, finding a sense of community in each of these places was really important for me. When I moved to Cleveland, I had a really hard time adjusting at first but found refuge in the Jewish community. While I would not consider myself super religous, I am very involved in Jewish culture and community. I joined BBYO, an international Jewish youth and social group, in high school and it helped me meet some of my best friends. Through BBYO, I got to cultivate my leadership skills, travel to Israel and Poland to visit the concentration camps (the most impactful experience of my life), and work with and meet Jewish teens from all around the world. My senior year I was president of BBYO for all of Ohio. I continue to stay involved in the Jewish community at Pitt as I am involved with both Hillel and Chabad. 
      
      I am also in the sorority Kappa Delta which has offered me a nice sisterhood at Pitt. I think that a sense of community is one of the most crucial things in life, and one of my favorite things is connecting and communicating with all types of new people and learning new perspectives. Thus, although it was hard I am so grateful for moving so much because it has taught to me how to form and maintain relationships with many people and places.</h2>

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment.

    <div class="par-centertext">   
  <h2>Throughout elementary and middle school, I moved around a lot. For high school, I finally stayed in one place. I attended an all-girls private school called Laurel. It was a very weird transition from a co-ed public school to an all-girls private school. However, my high school experience ended up being incredible. My school was very small and fostered a sense of community. Additionally, my school really emphasized STEAM and specific learning styles for women. I feel as if my school provided me with a lot of amazing skills and really prepared me for life as both a student and a women. I am so beyond happy to be attending college at Pitt. I think that Pitt is the perfect balance between big and small and a city and campus. I look forward to the rest of my time at Pitt and whatever the future holds for me.</h2>
